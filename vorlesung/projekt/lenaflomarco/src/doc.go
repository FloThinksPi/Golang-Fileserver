// In the files of a library package, you can attach a comment to the package
// name, which will be shown in the overview for that package's documentation.
// Just like for command documentation, the convention is to use a file called
// doc.go for your package documentation, though it is not necessary.  If you
// have comments on the package name in multiple files, they'll be concatenated,
// but generally it's best to just have comments in one file.
